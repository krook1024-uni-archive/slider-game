# About

## ... the project

*slider-game* is a Java implementation of a simple puzzle-like game where you *slide* objects of different shape, thus the name of *slide*r.

It builds upon OpenJFX as a GUI.

## ... the game

The board of the game is as seen below. It is a 4 by 6 table and the goal is to *slide* the square object inside of the other ones. You can move one piece at a time.
